# Environmental Concerns in Russia

This project shows the environmental concerns estimated as environmental topics mentioned by Russian Parliament members from 1994 to 2021.

The online project <a href="https://duma.dekoder.org/speeches">dekoder.org</a> (2021) titled "Duma Speeches: A Term Frequency Analysis" analyzed 385,000 speeches by Russian parliamentarians in the State Duma, covering the period from 1994 to 2021. The website presents a graph that displays the frequency of particular words mentioned in the speeches of parliamentarians.

The scrap.py file contains Python code that utilizes web scraping to gather a dataset of various Russian words and phrases from the dekoder.org website. These words and phrases are related to environmental problems and were mentioned by Russian parliamentarians over a period of 27 years. Based on the collected dataset, two graphs are constructed: (a) the number of mentions of environmental problems by year and (b) a word cloud that displays the relative popularity of each phrase related to environmental problems, calculated as the frequency of mentions.
The duma.ipynb file is the notebook presenting the output of the code.
